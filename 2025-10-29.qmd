*Write your answer to **one** A media environment that I interact with daily is Instagram. A question that could be answered through content analysis is if reels have better engagement than photos. I would like to measure shares, likes, and comments. I have done a content analysis on something similar like this in my undergrad. In my undergrad we had to do a social media audit where we analyzed how posting times and content were affected depending on their manifest content and the time they were posted and the audience. 
I think I would be equally focused on the manifest content and latent content of this hypothetical research. Because regarding what is actually there, a reel is significantly different from a post since it is a longer form of content and therefore can also convey more of an underlying tone or message because of its nature. However in today’s meme culture, some posts and photos may resonate more with an audience depending on the pictures or the captions included. Thus, to narrow my research question I think I would be interested in how reels do concerning engagement compared to memes and photo posts specifically. This would involve latent content because although a meme is a straightforward joke (you see the meme immediately upon scrolling), I have witnessed how memes can stem from different reels and videos.
I would be interested in this topic because as s social media admin for SIUE athletics, I could use the information on how to prioritize what kind of content I am collecting with athletes. Furthermore, memes of players and memes derived from reels of players, although they are both a form of a “meme”, can convey athletes in different ways because of the different types of content a reel and a post are.
A content analysis on something like this could involve posting a meme and a funny reel and evaluating engagement throughout the same period of time. Also, looking at previous posts and reels on an account and the likes, shares and comments and how they differ between the two. In my personal experience of posting reels and posts, I would guess that reels overall would have better engagement, However, some well-constructed memes could surpass reels spending on the content. That is, once again, where the factor of latent content comes into play because I think a reel’s engagement would typically surpass a post’s, but it is the underlying tone or message of a carefully and well curated post that could help it surpass a reel. 
Another way to analyze the content in a way that uses the reel content as a meme would be to post the reel on social media and also create a post derived from the reel, snipping the comedic part of it so users easily get the humor without watching the whole reel. I would be interested to see the results of both analysis.
